<li>To make the coux pastrey, place milk, sugar, butter 75ml(about 5 tablespoons) of water and a pinch of salt flakes in a saucepan over medium heat. Cook, stirring, for 2-3 minuets or until

<br/> Add flour, stirring to bring together into a dough. Using a wooden spoon, beat douh consistanly for 5 minuets or until catching on base of saucepan and coming away from the sides.</li><br/>
<li>Transfer to a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment and beat for 2 minuets or until loosened slightly. Increase the speed to medium-high and add the eggs, 1 at a time and making sure each
 egg is fully encorperated before adding the next, until smooth.</li><br/>
<li>Transfer the choux pastry to a piping bag fitted with a 1.2cm round nozzle and pipe 12cm lengths across prepared baking trays, leaving 3cm between each.
 Bake for 10 minuets, then reduce oven to 180 degrees celsius<br/>
 (about 360 degrees fahrenheit) and bake, swapping the top and bottom trays halfway,
 for a further 15 minuets or until puffed and golden. Remove from the oven and cool on trays for 10 minuets.</li><br/>
<li>Using a serrated knife, cut the cooled pasteris in half horizontally. Return tops and bases, cut-side up, to trays and bake for a further 10 minuets or until centers are dry to the touch. Cool.</li><br/>
<li>For the rose cherise glaze, place glucose, rosewater and cherries in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to the boil, breaking up with a wooden spoon. Strain, discarding solids, then set aside.</li><br/>
<li>Sift icing sugar into a bowl, making a well in the center. Add strained cherry liquid, stir to combine then add water, 1 teaspoon at a time and stirring constantly, until a smooth, loose consistency.
 <br/>Add food dye, 1 drop at a time, to achieve a soft pink color. Dip tops of pasteries into the glaze, then set aside on a wire rack over baking-paper-lined baking tray. Scatter the rose petals and allow to stand for 10 minuets or until set.</li><br/>
